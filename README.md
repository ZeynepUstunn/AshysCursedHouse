# AshysCursedHouse - VR Horror Escape Room Game
## Game Overview
*Ashy’s Cursed House* is an atmospheric virtual reality horror game that blends the tension of a haunted house with the mental challenge of an escape room. Players find themselves trapped inside a cursed house, where they must solve puzzles, uncover hidden codes, and escape before it's too late. Armed only with a flashlight, players explore dark and eerie environments, where every corner holds a clue or a danger waiting to be discovered.
*Ashy’s Cursed House* was developed by me, *[Merve Çankaya](https://github.com/cankayamerve)* and *[Zeki Furkan Yıldız](https://github.com/zekiyildiz)*, combining our creativity and technical skills to create an immersive and thrilling experience.
The game was originally designed as a desktop game and later integrated into a virtual reality experience, providing players with a more immersive and interactive environment. The transition from desktop to VR aimed to enhance the sense of immersion, allowing players to physically explore the environment, solve puzzles, and interact with objects more intuitively.

Below, you can find images and videos showcasing the desktop version of the game, providing a glimpse of its evolution and the design elements that were carried over to the VR version.
